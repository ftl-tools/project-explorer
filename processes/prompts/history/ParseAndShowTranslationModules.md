Update the design docs to plan a new feature addition. I want to list the translation modules referenced in Vue components as children of Vue Page Tree Items and Vue Component Tree Items. Translation modules are referenced like `$t("give_coins:select_reward_type")` or `this.$t("give_coins:select_reward_type")` which relates to the give coins translation module at `employee_app/app/public/locales/en/give_coins.json`. The translation tree items should use the translation.png icon. Please move this icon to the correct location.

Look through the current documentation, and understand how the system currently works, and how the docs are structured. Then please update the design to plan for this new feature addition. Create new folders and docs and update existing docs as needed. Make sure to follow the current design doc structure and style.
