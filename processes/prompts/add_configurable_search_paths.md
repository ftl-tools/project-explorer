Right now all top-level items in the tree view are hardcoded, and all parsers use hardcoded search paths. I want to change this. I want the user to be able to specify in the workspace settings a list of top-level items, the type of each item (app or docs), and the name and icon. There should also be a configurable list of search paths, the kind of search for each path like docs or vue router, and the top-level item it belongs to. Please add and change the design docs as needed to plan this new feature.

Is there a better or more natural way to implement this in the vscode workspace settings that would be more user-friendly, and easy to implement? Don't doc this yet, let's just plan it for now.
