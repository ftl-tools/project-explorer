Most of our parser doc files were way too long, detailed, and convoluted. I've gone back by hand and reworked the `/design_docs/project_parser/parsing_vue_router_files.md` and `/design_docs/project_parser/parsing_vue_component_files.md` files to be much better. I need you to read these files and then re-write the `/design_docs/project_parser/parsing_documentation_files` doc to be exactly like them. It should have all the same `##` level sections, each of these should be short, to the point, and written in the same format as the new Vue Router and Vue Component files. Use the same wording and approach wherever possible.
