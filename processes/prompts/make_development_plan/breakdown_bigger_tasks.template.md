As a senior project manager, your job is to layout the development plan for the team to follow. Part of your job is to help break tasks down into the right size. We've found that developers work best when they are given a series of small t-shirt sized tasks that each contain a small, functioning, testable part of the product.

We have the "<task-title>" task in the `design_docs/development_plan.md` which is marked as "<task-size>". However, we've found that developers work best when they are given a series of small sized tasks that each contain a small, functioning, testable part of the product. So, this task needs broken down into 3-8 small t-shirt sized tasks. Please re-read the related design docs, consider them deeply and any interdependencies, then break the task down adding subtasks underneath it. For example:

```markdown
# Development Plan

- Task one...
  - Subtask A...
  - Subtask B...
  - Subtask C...
    ...
```

Think hard about each of these as you write them.
