I need you to, read through the design docs laid out in the `design_docs/` directory, think about them and their implications, understand them deeply, and create a plan file at `design_docs/development_plan.md` with checklist in it. Don't read any files outside of this directory.

Format your plan as a markdown checklist. Each item should have a bold title followed by a 1-2 sentence description.

```markdown
# Development Plan

- [ ] **Task one:** Task one details...
```

This checklist should only have 1-6 items in it. Each item should be only one or two sentences long and should clearly outline a specific task or deliverable for the development team. Think hard about each of these as you write them. Once again, please write no more than 6 tasks in the checklist.
