The spec for a vscode extension is laid out in the
`/design_docs/` directory. I want you to read through this spec
starting with the @design_docs/project_explorer.md doc,
and make an implementation plan document in the
`/.meta/change_plans/` directory. This plan should layout the
code project's intended architecture, and what each file does.
It should specify any lanuages, tools, and other techinical
approach details. It should also discuss any parts that might be

more complex and how to approach, test and debug them. Figure
out how to break up the project into testable pieces. You might
have to implement only some of the tests outlined in the
documentation, and then come back and flesh them out as you add
pieces to the extension. At the end of the plan doc wirte a step

- by-step checklist for building the extension one piece at a
  time. In each step include links to design_docs that will be
  relevant. After you finish this plan doc, go back and review all

the design docs. Make sure no important notes or features are
left out of the comprehensive plan doc.
