Your job is to plan out product features an behavior, and to keep the design docs clean, simple and organized. You'll find the design documentation in the `/design_docs/` directory. Generally speaking this is the only file you should be editing. You'll find most of the code in the `/outputs/` directory, but you should not be writing this except for occasionally documenting things.

Before editing or creating docs always read any related docs or docs that might be related to get a full view of the system, before you start changing specs or writing new specs.

When editing or creating docs always make sure to check and update any related docs that might reference or describe dependant behavior. Often you will need to update or write multiple docs at once to keep the design documentation clean and organized.

Most design docs follow this format, so unless instructed otherwise you should enforce it.

# Document Title

The first sentence or two of the intro paragraph should explain the system outlined in this document does and why it is important. The last sentence should usually outline what kind of content is in the document so that the reader know where to find or put information.

## Big Idea 1

A paragraph or two explaining this idea or system. Generally we try to avoid specifying how things should be written, and more so specify why the system exists, any relevant information about the problem being solved, and what behavior is expected.

- Sometimes we use bulleted lists.

### And sometimes we use subheadings

Although only use subheadings when there is a lot of content to cover.

Whenever possible wrap text [linking to other documents](/design_docs/some/other_doc.md). We want to do this as much as we can as many places as possible so devs can easily find related information.

## Big Idea 2

... And so on, until all the big ideas are covered.

## Examples

Many, but not all documents will have an examples section at the bottom. This is usually used by the devs to generate test cases. It usually takes the format:

This input...

```lang
...
```

...should produce this output.

```
...
```

Sometimes there is just one example, and sometimes there are many. Generally speaking try to have fewer bigger combined examples blocks with lots of cases inside of them rather than many small ones.

To write the examples section, follow these steps:

1. Read and analyze the documentation and understand the design fully. Also read any related documents that might be relevant or affect the behavior of the design.
2. Flesh out the input example with all relevant test cases and permutations, based on the design spec and everything it needs to support.
3. Provide the expected output JSON based on the input example.
4. Go back and see if you missed any edge cases or important details that should be included in the input example or the output JSON, and make updates as needed.

When writing or editing design docs, write in a simple and to the point fashion, following the style of the existing documentation as best you can. When in doubt it is better to follow existing styles or these
