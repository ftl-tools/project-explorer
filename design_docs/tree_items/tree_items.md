# Tree Items

Tree items are rendered in tree views.

## All Tree Items

The extension has the following tree item types/handlers:

[//]: # "{ TODO: In future, autogenerate this list }"

- **[User Defined](/design_docs/tree_items/user_defined_tree_items.md):** Users should be able to define custom items show up in the [tree view](/design_docs/project_explorer.md#rendering-tree-items). This doc outlines how this should work.
- **[Docs](/design_docs/tree_items/doc_tree_items/doc_tree_items.md):** Doc tree items allow users to traverse documentation in their workspace. This doc outlines how this should work.

## Tree Item JSON Format

They are tracked using the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "item-id",
  "typeAndPath": "itemType:item/path",
  "icon": "iconSource:icon/path/or/id.svg",
  "label": "Item Label",
  "parentId": "parent-item-id"
}
```

Let's break these down in detail:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the item.

  <summary>Test that</summary>

  </details><br>

- `typeAndPath`: A string that specifies both the type and path of the item separated by a `:`. We combine these two into one property because usually they should both be defined or neither of them defined. The behavior of this item will change based on the type:

  - `file:path/to/file.txt`: When tapped open the file in the editor. When no icon is specified, use the default icon for this file type.
  - `folder:path/to/folder`: When tapped open the folder in the explorer. When no icon is specified, use the default icon for this file type.
  - `url:https://example.com`: When tapped open the URL in an external browser. When no icon is specified, attempt to fetch and use the siteâ€™s favicon; while loading show the VS Code globe codicon (`$(globe)`), and if favicon fetching fails, keep using the globe.
  - `script:<command and args>`: When tapped run the command headlessly using the system shell. Script items have the VS Code run codicon (`$(run)`) by default, cannot have children, and are disabled while running. While running, append `...` to the label. Optional `cwd` and `env` fields control working directory and environment variables. If the script succeeds show a pop-up with the output, and if it fails show an error pop-up with the error message. Only one run per item may be active at a time.
  - _Note: Some tree item types might override these default behaviors._

- `icon`: Optionally specify a custom icon for this item. This can take a few formats.

  - `local:path/to/icon.svg`: Use a local SVG located in the user's workspace.
  - `vscode:icon-id`: Use a built-in VS Code icon by its codicon ID (e.g., `vscode:globe`).
  - `projectExplorer:icon-id`: Use an icon defined in the Project Explorer extension's resources (e.g., `projectExplorer:lightbulb`).
  - `remote:https://example.com/icon.svg`: Use an icon from a remote URL.

- `label`: Optionally specify a custom label for this item. If not specified, use the last part of the path in [title case](/design_docs/utils/name_casing.md#title-case) without the file extension (e.g., `My File` for `file:custom/my-file.txt`).

- `parentId`: Optionally specify the ID of the parent item. If not specified, the item will be a top-level item in the tree. If specified, the item will be nested under the parent item with that ID.
